## What is this app?
"What to Make?" allows users to discover the meals they can make for dinner based on what ingredients they already have. A user can either scroll through all the meals, or if they fill in their "My Ingredients" list, the meals are re-ordered to show the meals that are missing the least ingredients.

A user can get more detail on how to make a meal and what other ingredients the meal needs by tapping on a meal.

## How does the app help a user navigate?
### Main activity

The "My Ingredients" list can be opened by swiping left from the right side of the screen or pressing the "My Ingredients" button on the action bar.

#### Landscape
The "My Ingredients" list is shown alongside the meal cards.

### Meal detail activity
Swiping left or right allows the user to navigate between meals in the order they are in on the main page.
